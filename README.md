This is my umth-time trying to create a website using express, react, mongo , chakra and javascript. I have had several ather attempts, but; I have had problems getting them to properly sync
to github and I eneded up making changed I could not bounce back from and had to start over. I will use my framework for my build going forward expanding on 
different ideas.

The front end : 
npm run dev

the back end :
npm create vite@latest .   
npm run dev

navigate to the posted url in the terminal. 

Features:
Add a new page to the existing page - 
Add a new restaurant to the exiting restaurant page. 
add a search function to find and add resturants
I added a product function, just to utilize my existing structure 
and get the practice with routes and MongoDB using clusters
